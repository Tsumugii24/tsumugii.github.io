# Research and Project

### HAMLET

**Hyperadaptive Agent‑based Modeling for Live Embodied Theatrics (HAMLET)** 

![](drama.png)

Supervised by Prof. **Xuelong Li**, Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom, China

- Co‑first author; preprint: [arXiv:2507.15518](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15518).
- Proposed HAMLET, a multi‑agent system that generates complete online drama performances from a single user instruction.
- Conducted model training, win‑rate evaluation, and ablation studies.

This is our demonstration of core multi-agent system design for AI-Driven Drama.

### LINKs

**LLM Integrated Management for 6G Empowered Digital Twin Networks (LINKs)** 

![](system.png)

Supervised by Dr. **Yue Wu**, School of Information Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, China

- First author; accepted at IEEE VTC2024‑Fall; preprint: [arXiv:2412.19811](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19811).
- Built an autonomous network management framework featuring multi‑agent collaboration, self‑reflection, and a comprehensive tool‑use stack.
- Fine‑tuned `TimesFM` with `LoRA`, achieving SOTA performance on network traffic prediction.

</p>


Supervised by Dr. **Ke Fang**, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, China

- Designed an island‑themed social‑simulation game in Unity; published on [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/fortnight-test-01/rate/3023833).
- Implemented LLM‑driven NPCs with planning, reasoning, memory, and tool‑use.
- Enabled NPC skill evolution through interaction and collaboration.

### PoetryChat

**LLM‑based Interactive Chinese Poetry Learning Assistant**

    <img src="ios-poetry.png" width="250" /> 
    <img src="poetrychat.png" width="470" />   
</p>


- Designed structured prompts for text‑to‑image generation and dialogue across age groups; integrated with LangChain.
- Implemented multimodal RAG by extracting document images and re‑captioning with BLIP2‑OPT‑6.7B for cross‑modal alignment; built vector stores for retrieval.
- Developed a React web app with history tracking, theme switching, web search, dark mode, and RAG file upload.

### MGLCD

**Multi‑Granularity Lesion Cell Detection Using Deep Neural Networks**

    </p>
</div>


Supervised by Prof. **Pietro Liò**, Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, UK

- Curated and annotated 2,000+ medical cell images across 7 categories from Kaggle, Hugging Face, and other sources.
- Preprocessed with OpenCV (denoising, deduplication) and Mosaic augmentation for diversity.
- Trained CNN and Transformer‑based detectors (YOLO series, ViT, DETR).
